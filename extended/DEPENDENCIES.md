# Extended pipeline dependencies

The extended pipeline depends on the following software. We list the recommended
and tested versions for each release of taxator-tk starting from v1.3.3

Note, that the versions that can be installed via package manager in recent
Linux distributions may differ and may be incompatible. For this reason, and to
be most reproducible, I recommend to install the exact versions listed below,
which are also containted in the binary extended release package.

If you use a different setup, please report all program versions with your
results.
