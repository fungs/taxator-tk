This file only lists changes for the extended version of taxator-tk, see
taxator-tk source code for detailed algorithmic changes. All extended
releases are based on taxator-tk source versions which are equal (or
lower when the code base did not change between minor versions).

v. 1.3.3e
=========
* fix crashes in all LCA algorithms
* more consistent behavior of command line parameters in taxknife
* better error reporting

v. 1.3.1e
=========
* suppress some notifications
* set more options via variable with LAST and BLAST
* refactor shell code for cleaner workflows and improve POSIX compatibility
* better CPU core detection via numproc command (supports containers)
* specification of output folder (backward-compatible behavior)

v. 1.3.0e
=========
* much better scaling core algorithm due to homolog selection heuristic,
  there is no need to restrict the number of input alignments any more
* CPU core auto-detection, now working with Linux taskset/cpusets
* support for multi-core alignment with LAST (lastal-parallel wrapper script)
* support of parallel search with LAST by integration of GNU parallel in
  script lastal-parallel, uses lz4 compression of temporary data
* faster conversion by integration of GNU parallel in script 
  lastmaf2alignments-parallel
* integration of KronaTools for interactive pie chart plotting
* LAST update to v.508
* download script for sample refpack removed, the project page will point
  to a location from where to download refpacks

v. 1.2.2-extended
=================
* make reference data and aligner index location independent of program
  installation folder, makes it easier to run it in multiuser environments
* remove integrity check for any data (should become part of the repack)
* rename and clean all scripts
* change standard BLAST algorithm to "discontiguous megablast" for better
  sensitivity (increases the run-time by ~20x)

v. 1.2.1-extended
=================
* fix bug in binning-workflow-fasta-last.sh, reference FASTA index wasn't used
* replaced quickstart.pdf by a text-based README file

v. 1.2.0-extended
=================
* new non-redundant reference data with updated taxonomy
* taxator speedup (all aligners), BLAST parameter optimization
* rank-filter and name-filter tools unified into taxknife
* binner gives an integer support value (bp) for each classified input sequence
  + new taxon support summary
* logging disabled by default for smaller size of result folder
* results are created in current working instead of "working/" folder
  (admin/multiuser improvement)
* minor file/folder restructuring

v. 1.1.1-extended
=================
* fix typo bug in create-index-last.sh
* quickstart manual update

v. 1.1.0-extended
=================
* workflow executable on workstations (new indexed FASTA feature in taxator; with BLAST)
* SEQAN update with faster alignments (>2x speed improvement)
* switch to NCBI BLAST+ (nucleotide megablast) as default, option to use LAST
* general cleanup/improvement of included workflow scripts, no Python required any more in BLAST workflow

v. 1.0-extended
===============
* first pre-compiled static binary package for 64 bit Linux
* sample workflow shell scripts for taxonomic binning
* includes microbial RefSeq with taxonomy
* large prepared LAST index with download script
* optimized for large-memory systems
