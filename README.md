# taxator-tk
A set of programs for the taxonomic analysis of nucleotide sequence data

## Introduction
This is the source code for the taxator toolkit. If you are looking for pre-packaged
programs or sample refpacks for taxonomic assignment, please go to the
[official download page](http://research.bifo.helmholtz-hzi.de/webapps/wa-download/).

This repository consists of two parts, the actual taxator-tk C++ code in the folder `core` and the pipeline scripts which are used to build the ready-to-use binary distribution in folder `extended`.

All issues can be filed in the
[official GitHub repository](https://github.com/fungs/taxator-tk/issues/).

## Documentation
Please see separate documentation:
* [global build and install guide](INSTALL.md)
* [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)
* [core compilation guide](core/BUILD.md)
* [core detailed usage instructions](core/USAGE.md)
* [core dependencies](core/DEPENDENCIES.md)
* [extended pipeline description](extended/README.md)
* [extended pipeline dependencies](extended/DEPENDENCIES.md)

## FAQ

### Help, the majority of assigned taxa are unspecific, like phylum or (super)kingdom, what can I do?

### Why do taxator-tk pipelines run so long compared to others?

### Can the sequences classification be accelerated?

### Is taxator-tk made for reads or assembled sequences? Or is the program targeted towards a specific sequencing platform?

### If a sequence was assigned to a taxon by the algorithm, where can I see why?

### Can I use taxator-tk with targeted sequencing data like amplicons?

### Why do I get an error if there are spaces in the FASTA identifiers?

### I'm running out of memory. Can I run taxator-tk on my desktop machine?

### What is the advantage/disadvanage in using taxator-tk over fast k-mer or hash based sequence classification with programs like Centrifuge or Kraken?

### What is the advantage/disadvantage in using taxator-tk over marker gene phylogenetic placement with programs like MetagPhlan, CheckM, RAxML or pplacer?

### What is a refpack?

### Where can I find refpacks?

### I want to build my own refpack, why do I have mapping problems with taxonomic identifiers?

### Can I use a different taxonomy than NCBI?

### Should I use a nucleotide or protein alignment and classification pipeline?

### I want to use taxator-tk with aligner XYZ, can I?

### Can I use taxator-tk to quantify relative in-sample or between-sampe abundances?

### Why are some of the input sequences not listed in the final results files?

### I want to use a pipeline but it says that some program is missing. What can I do?

### What does the support value in the output mean?



## Code licensing
The taxator-tk source is licensend under the GPLv3 but builds on other free software components, which have their own respective licenses and are listed under dependencies.
