# taxator-tk
A set of programs for the taxonomic analysis of nucleotide sequence data

## Introduction
This is the source code for the taxator toolkit. If you are looking for pre-packaged
programs or sample refpacks for taxonomic assignment, please go to the
[official download page](http://algbio.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/software/).

Issues concerning the extended version (binaries, workflow scripts etc.) which you have downloaded from the official download page should be mailed to us (see contact below).

Issues which apply to the taxator-tk core can be filed in the
[official GitHub repository](https://github.com/fungs/taxator-tk/).

## Code licensing

* SeqAn (BSD license), http://www.seqan.de, version 1.4.1
* Boost (Boost Software License), http://www.boost.org, version "not too old"
* tree.hh (GPLv3), http://tree.phi-sci.com, version 2.81

More information can be found in the folder licenses and in the header source code.
