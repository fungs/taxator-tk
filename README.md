# taxator-tk
A set of programs for the taxonomic analysis of nucleotide sequence data

## Introduction
This is the source code for the taxator toolkit. If you are looking for pre-packaged
programs or sample refpacks for taxonomic assignment, please go to the
[official download page](http://research.bifo.helmholtz-hzi.de/webapps/wa-download/).

This repository consists of two parts, the actual taxator-tk C++ code in the folder `core` and the pipeline scripts which are used to build the ready-to-use binary distribution in folder `extended`.

All issues can be filed in the
[official GitHub repository](https://github.com/fungs/taxator-tk/issues/).

## Documentation
Please see separate documentation:
* [global build and install guide](INSTALL.md)
* [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)
* [core tools compilation guide](core/BUILD.md)
* [core tools detailed usage instructions](core/USAGE.md)
* [core dependencies](core/DEPENDENCIES.md)
* [extended pipeline description](extended/README.md)
* [extended pipeline dependencies](extended/DEPENDENCIES.md)
